Project 3 - Raycasting

## About

This project uses raycasting to simulate a tank popping balloons as they slowly
drop down.  They can't be hit before they're moving, and the laser must be
clicked or held down.  It has limited battery.

## QA

I generally like challenges but this one is a bit doesn't make sense to me.
